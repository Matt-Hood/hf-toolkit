# Composer template for Drupal projects
## Package features
### Asset packagist support
The Asset packagist package acts as a bridge between Composer and the popular NPM and Bower repositories, which catalog
thousands of useful front-end and JavaScript packages. This allows developers to easily pull in packages like DropZoneJS
and many others without requiring local Node.js to be installed.

### Guardr core security
Guardr is a Drupal distribution with a combination of modules and settings to enhance a Drupal application's security
and availability to meet enterprise security requirements. This project leverages Guardr's package management and
module configuration.

### Sub-profile support
A Drupal core patch has been included to add support for "Sub-profiles".

See: https://www.drupal.org/node/1356276

### Support for installs from existing configuration
A Drupal core patch has been included to allow projects to be installed from existing configuration.

See: https://www.drupal.org/node/2788777

### Rain base profile features
The [Mediacurrent Rain base install profile](https://bitbucket.org/mediacurrent/mis_rain/) includes many of the most
common packages pre-configured for rapid site development and optional content features.

## Setting up a local [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) environment

### Install composer on host machine
- On MacOS ```brew install composer```
- Otherwise, see instructions here https://getcomposer.org/

### Clone this project and follow the New Project Setup procedure up to the "Build Site" step:
- `$ git clone git@bitbucket.org:mediacurrent/drupal-project.git`
- Follow this, stop before "Build Site": https://codeandtheory.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MC/pages/63242682/New+Project+Setup
- Before the first time you run the build script, proceed to the next section: "Rename & configure sample 'mis_profile' install profile".

### Rename & configure sample 'mis_profile' install profile
- Rename the mis_profile directory to the name of your project
- Find and replace all instances of 'mis_profile' with your project name
- Enable desired base profile features and modules (see mis_profile.install for more instructions).

### Edit your local `/etc/hosts` file to include the new box IP
    192.168.50.4 example.mcdev

### Run the build script.
- `$ ./scripts/build.sh`

This script automates the following steps:

* Runs composer install
* Ensures vagrant is available
* Starts vagrant if required
* Installs the project Drupal site

The initial pass of the build script downloads several dependencies and an intermittent internet connection will affect the initial build process.

At this point, you can return to the procedure outlined in the [New Project Setup document](https://codeandtheory.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MC/pages/63242682/New+Project+Setup).

### Troubleshooting
* Ensure Vagrant has provisioned without errors. Correct errors before proceeding. After vagrant provision is successful it maybe be helpful to vagrant halt && vagrant up`

## Drush Alias
* Use the project's [drush alias file](drush/example.mcdev.aliases.drushrc.php)
* Optionally copy into your user's drush directory at ~/.drush/ for global use or customization.

## Logging In
* Use `drush @example.mcdev uli` to login to your local installation.

## Adding the sync folder to be used with new installs
* The first time build.sh runs successfully you will be able to export configuration back to your project's sync folder.
* Add an empty folder named 'sync' at profile/profilename/config/sync.
* Add `$config_directories['sync'] = $app_root . '/profiles/profilename/config/sync';` to your local settings.php.
* Run `drush @example.mcdev cex` to export configuration to the sync folder.
* Re-run `$ ./scripts/build.sh` to test install with sync configuration.
* Once this is working as expected, add the sync folder to git and commit.

## Development Settings
* The ./web/sites/example.mcdev/settings.local.php contains settings for customizing the development environment.  This disables Drupal's built in caching and additionally activates sites/development.services.yml for further customizing the development environment.

# Development Workflow

* [Use Composer](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-composer-to-manage-drupal-site-dependencies#managing-contributed) to add 3rd party dependencies and patches.
* Write custom modules, themes etc. to the ./web/ directory.
* Run `drush @example.mcdev cex` to export Drupal configuration to the profile/profilename/config/sync folder.
* Run `$ ./scripts/build.sh` before starting a new ticket. Run build.sh again to test work completed prior to submitting a pull request.

## Demo Content
* TBD

The [drupal-scaffold](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold) plugin can download the scaffold files (like
index.php, update.php, â€¦) to the web/ directory of your project. If you have not customized those files you could choose
to not check them into your version control system (e.g. git). If that is the case for your project it might be
convenient to automatically run the drupal-scaffold plugin after every install or update of your project. You can
achieve that by registering `@composer drupal:scaffold` as post-install and post-update command in your composer.json:

```json
"scripts": {
    "post-install-cmd": [
        "@composer drupal:scaffold",
        "..."
    ],
    "post-update-cmd": [
        "@composer drupal:scaffold",
        "..."
    ]
},
```
### How can I apply patches to downloaded modules?

If you need to apply patches (depending on the project being modified, a pull 
request is often a better solution), you can do so with the 
[composer-patches](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches) plugin.

To add a patch to drupal module foobar insert the patches section in the extra 
section of composer.json:
```json
"extra": {
    "patches": {
        "drupal/foobar": {
            "Patch description": "URL or local path to patch"
        }
    }
}
```
### How do I switch from packagist.drupal-composer.org to packages.drupal.org?

Follow the instructions in the [documentation on drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-packagesdrupalorg).

### How do I specify a PHP version ?

Currently Drupal 8 supports PHP 5.5.9 as minimum version (see [Drupal 8 PHP requirements](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/system-requirements/drupal-8-php-requirements)), however it's possible that a `composer update` will upgrade some package that will then require PHP 7+.

To prevent this you can add this code to specify the PHP version you want to use in the `config` section of `composer.json`:
```json
"config": {
    "sort-packages": true,
    "platform": {"php": "5.5.9"}
},
```
